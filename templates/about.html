        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #6a1b9a; margin-top: 15px;">
            Ice cream, with its sweet charm and frosty touch, traces its roots back to ancient China where a frozen mixture of milk and rice was enjoyed as early as 200 BC. The modern version we savor today began to take shape in 17th century Europe, especially in Italy and France, eventually becoming a global favorite.
